# Address Map
Exercise for multithreaded concurrent programming in Java

## Instructions
1. Checkout the master branch to start in your favorite IDE. It is a maven project.
2. In the package de.cas.mse.address.map.compute.concurrent you find the classes to implement
4. The de.cas.mse.address.map.compute.Service class provides access to the calculation engine 
5. You can check the sequential implementation about how to get the data

## Ideas to think about
* Which other code places needed to be taken into account when parallel access is introduced?
* How big was the visible performance improvement in comparison to the measured.
